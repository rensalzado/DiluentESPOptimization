# DiluentESPOptimization
TEP4905 â€“ NTNU Master Thesis, Energy and Process Engineering Department
Specialization: Industrial Process Technology
 
 The objective of the master thesis was to develop a numerical model from a single-phase, vertical oil well
 in stationary state to study the effects of dilution to improve oil production. The model has the option to 
 include a electrical submersible centrifugal pump (ESP). The model was developed using an object-oriented
 programming approach to increase portability and usability.
 
 This reposity includes:
 - Classes codes
 - Technical reports providing insights from different areas of the model
